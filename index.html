        <h2> <p> 
            A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard.
             It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard 
             is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered
              a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers .
